# Git Hook Example

## Clarification

1. See the `post-receive` hook script [here](deploy/production.git/hooks/post-receive)

1. I minimized the `main.js` example, which makes it a bit clearer and easier to start without npm script.

1. The `App` folder is not clickable bc it's a git submodule, the content of which stays the same with what are in the `master` branch.
